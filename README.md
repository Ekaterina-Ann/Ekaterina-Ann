### Hi there, I'm Ekaterina Zbrishchak ðŸ‘‹

For many years I worked as an architect. I ran my own projects. This taught me a responsible approach to work and meeting deadlines. My passion for analysis led me to pursue a new career in data science. I successfully completed the data science course from Yandex Practicum and am now open to looking for a new job.

###### Databases: 
PostgreSQL

###### Data Science: 
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
